# Control-System-for-a-Coordinated-Steady-Turn
Aim of the project is to carry out the study of a given aircraft at a chosen flight condition. Once this has been set, it is required to compare Matlab results of the linearized model matrices (Alat, Alon) and the poles and relevant zeros, with the hand-calculated ones. Finally, the construction of two Stability Augmentation systems (SAS) and two Autopilots are needed in order to improve the flight handling qualities and to track a given input signal. The flight condition analyzed in this project is the coordinated steady turn, allowing to invert the route in exactly 60 seconds. This is observable in figure 1, where it is clearly visible how the yaw angle reaches the value of 3 rad and how the trajectory is completely inverted after one minute.
